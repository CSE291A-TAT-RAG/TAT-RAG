We may face legal action by third parties seeking to enforce their intellectual property rights related\nto our use of such open source software.

From time to time, there have been\nclaims against companies that distribute or use third-party open source software in their products and services,\nasserting that the open source software or its combination with the products or services infringes third parties’ patents\nor copyrights, or that the companies’ distribution or use of the open source software does not comply with the terms\nof the applicable open source licenses. Use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of\nwarranted third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls\non the origin of such open source software. From time to time, there have been claims against companies that use\nopen source software in their products, challenging the ownership of rights in such open source software. As a result,\nwe could also be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of rights in what we believe to be open source\nsoftware and so challenging our right to use such software in our products. If any such claims were asserted against\nus, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such a claim. Further, if our defenses\nto such a claim were not successful, we could be, for example, subject to significant damages, be required to seek\nlicenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products and services without infringing such third party’s\nintellectual property rights, be required to re-engineer such products and services, or be required to discontinue\nmaking available such products and services if re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful\nbasis.

Recruiting and retaining qualified distribution channel partners and training them on our technologies\nrequires significant time and resources. These distribution channel partners may also market, sell and support\nproducts and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales and\nsupport of such competitive products. Our sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability and\nreputational harm if, for example, any of our distribution channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our\nproducts or services to end-customers or violate laws or our corporate policies. If we are unable to establish or\nmaintain our sales channels or if our distribution channel partners are unable to adapt to our future sales focus and\nneeds, our business and results of operations will be harmed.",

    "content": "Generally accepted accounting principles (‘‘GAAP’’) in the United States are subject to interpretation by the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret\nappropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on\nour reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of\na change. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (Topic 606),\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under\nU.S. GAAP. We adopted Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018, applying the modified retrospective method to all\ncontracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. This or other changes in accounting principles could\nadversely affect our financial results, including the comparability of our results. See Note 1 of our Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report regarding the effect of new accounting\npronouncements on our financial statements. Any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us\nto fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’\nconfidence in us.",

In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the\nincome tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent\nthat a company’s accounting for Tax Act-related income tax effects is incomplete, but the company is able to\ndetermine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in its financial statements. If a company cannot\ndetermine a provisional estimate to be included in its financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on\nthe basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. We\nhave completed our analysis of the Tax Act’s income tax effects. In accordance with SAB 118, the Tax Act-related\nincome tax effects that we initially reported as provisional estimates were refined as additional analysis was\nperformed. We have elected to account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income under the Tax Act as period costs\nwhen incurred. There was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements when our analysis was\ncompleted in the fourth quarter of 2018.",
